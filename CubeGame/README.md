HW10 – This homework was extremely time consuming but very rewarding. It was challenging figuring everything out every step of the way. Part of my problem was instead of trying to change the background color on every collision I was trying to change the color of each RECT on collision which was working just a little buggy. I believe I have satisfied all the requirements however there are two bugs that the users should be aware of:
A)	When the square that the user can control increased in size drastically the collision detections need it to hit the upper right-hand corner for the collision to register.
B)	On collision, the auto square bounces the size of the user controlled square in the direction it was going when they collided, so if you hit the auto square right on the border you can send the auto square outside of the canvas to never be seen again.
Despite these two bugs that aren’t extremely complicated, just time consuming, I am happy with the output of this minigame. This game helps me work out some of the physics behind the game I am trying to create for my final project.
