Bugs to be aware of.  
A)	When the square that the user can control increased in size drastically the collision detections need it to hit the upper right-hand corner for the collision to register.  
B)	On collision, the auto square bounces the size of the user controlled square in the direction it was going when they collided, so if you hit the auto square right on the border you can send the auto square outside of the canvas to never be seen again.
Despite these two bugs that arenâ€™t extremely complicated, just time consuming, I am happy with the output of this minigame. This game helps me work out some of the physics behind the game,
